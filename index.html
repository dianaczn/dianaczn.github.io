<!-- TECHNICAL REPORT
    1. The method that I used to password protect my website by using a while-loop, 
       and an if-else statement. If you type in the correct password it re-directs 
       you to a new window where the actual webpage is displayed.

    2. The new tag that I tried was the image tag. I have never used it before as 
       this is my first webpage. The following images that I used it for was the logo
       I had designed for my name and the four travelling pictures. The outcome of this
       tag was that it allowed the images to appear on the webpage to the very left of 
       the screen. The only reason why the four bottom images aren't all to the left
       is because I alligned them. 

    3. My webpage looks the same in different web browsers. The specific two that I
       used were safari and google chrome. Both webpages displayed the same webpage 
       with no major differences. The biggest difference between the two was the pop-up
       where the webpage prompts the user to enter the password before proceeding. On
       google chrome, the pop-up is to the top center where as on safari the pop-up
       is in the center of the webpage. 

    4. I spent apporximately 2 hours on this lab. The reason being is that this is 
       my first webpage ever created so I played around with some of the tags and 
       features provided on the class notes. After I got used to some of the features
       I planned out how I wanted my website to look and proceeded to achieve my goal.
